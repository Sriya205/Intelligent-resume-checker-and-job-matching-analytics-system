# Intelligent-resume-checker-and-job-matching-analytics-system
#### The Intelligent Resume Checker and Job Matching Analytics System is a data-driven application designed to assist HR teams in automating the resume screening and job matching process. The system analyzes candidate resumes and compares them with job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to identify the most suitable candidates for a given role.

#### The project focuses on solving the problem of manual resume shortlisting, which is time-consuming and prone to human bias. By leveraging skill-based matching, text preprocessing, and similarity scoring, the system provides an objective and efficient way to evaluate resumes.

#### The solution is currently designed for a single organization, allowing HR professionals to upload resumes and receive ranked job matches based on skills, experience, and job requirements. The system architecture is modular and scalable, making it adaptable for future multi-company integration.

#### This project demonstrates the practical application of data science, machine learning, and backend development concepts in a real-world HR analytics use case.
